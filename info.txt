This is a simple chat program written by Jeremiah Embs of EmbsComputerArt.com
made freely available for non-commericial use. This version (0.5) is still beta
so feel free to modify it for your purposes, to improve it, and to debug it.
To deploy the platform upload these files to a separate directory on your webserver:

messages.txt, index.php, user.php, and chatroom.php

and make sure the default user the webserver uses has write permissions to
messages.txt (using permissions 664 worked for me).

Point your friends to the directory and you can chat.

Enjoy! And #FuckZuck #EndCensorship #LiveFreeOrDie #AcceptChrist
